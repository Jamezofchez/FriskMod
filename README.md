Adds Frisk from UNDERTALE into Slay The Spire

## Mechanics:

Most of the cards are centered around one of the previous fallen Humans.

### Patience:

*“I must attend to some business, and you must stay alone for a while. Please remain here”*  
Create **Countdowns** that trigger effects after a certain amount of cards have been played. Will you rush through your cards for an immediate effect, or hold it out for a massive conclusion?

### Bravery:

*“The more you kill ... The more you distance yourself ... The more easily you can bring yourself to hurt others”.*

Enemies can gain **LV**, which increases their Attack. When you have **LV**, your next Attack played will gain **XP**, which increases the damage of the card its bound to. Upon dealing unblocked damage to an enemy, the card will lose its XP and transfer one less **LV** to the enemy, while gaining **XP** equal to one less **LV** the enemy had.
Simply put, cards with experience deal more damage. When dealing damage to an enemy, greater killing intent will increase their desire to hurt you, and attacking a stronger enemy will increase your card's experience.

### Kindness

*“Love yourself\! I love you\!”*

**Give** your enemy various Buffs, such as Block or LV. But don’t be a pushover, as you can **Steal** these buffs for yourself, and perhaps these “buffs” aren’t as desirable as they seem…

### Integrity:

*“Critical pet\! Dog excitement increased.”*

Deal **Critical** effects when cards are played from the middle of your hand. Some of the more power cards are here, if only you can trigger them.

### Justice:

*“Doomed to the death of KARMA\!”*

Inflict your enemies with **KARMA**, which causes them to lose HP whenever you lose HP. But be careful, as it won’t kill on its own.

### Perseverence:

*“(You're filled with determination.)"*

**Persevere** cards, allowing yourself to play them for just 1 HP while bypassing any conditions for playability. However, cards persevered will become **Trapped**, becoming normally Unplayable and causing you to lose one energy when drawn.

*“Despite everything, it’s still you”*
